But instead of flying, she fell down with a thump. The next day, she tried again and fell down again. This happened for many days, until one day, a wise old owl saw her trying to fly. He laughed and asked her, -Why don't you just be a chicken and enjoy walking and pecking at the ground instead of trying to fly? The silly chicken thought about it and realized the owl was right. From then on, she was happy being a chicken and didn't try to fly anymore. And she lived happily ever after, pecking at the ground and enjoying her life as a chicken."
